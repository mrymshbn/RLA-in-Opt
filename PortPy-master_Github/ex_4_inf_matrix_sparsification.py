### PortPy provides full dense influence matrix (i.e., including all scattering components) and a truncated sparse
    version (used for computational efficiency). This example clarifies the relationship and differences between
    these matrices by showing the followings:
    1- generating a plan using the sparse matrix (default matrix in PortPy)
    2- calculating the full dose for the plan using the full matrix
    3- manually calculating the sparse matrix from the full matrix
